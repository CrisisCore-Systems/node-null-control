# Transformation Map: [CLIENT/SYSTEM NAME]

Use this template for **high-stakes client or system change**. This is operational psychology, not marketing fluff.

---

## Starting State

**Current reality:**

[Describe the client/system's current operating state — capabilities, limitations, behaviors]

**Key characteristics:**

- [Characteristic 1]
- [Characteristic 2]
- [Characteristic 3]

---

## Hidden Friction

What's blocking change that isn't obvious:

| Friction Point | Why It's Hidden | Impact |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| [Friction 1] | [Why people don't see it] | [What it blocks] |
| [Friction 2] | [Why people don't see it] | [What it blocks] |
| [Friction 3] | [Why people don't see it] | [What it blocks] |

## False Beliefs

Beliefs the client/system holds that are incorrect:

| False Belief | Why They Believe It | Truth |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| [Belief 1] | [Source of belief] | [What's actually true] |
| [Belief 2] | [Source of belief] | [What's actually true] |
| [Belief 3] | [Source of belief] | [What's actually true] |

## Critical Intervention

**The single action that creates irreversible forward momentum:**

[Describe the intervention]

**Why this works:** [Mechanism]

**Why alternatives fail:** [What doesn't work and why]

---

## Moment of Irreversibility

**The point at which reverting becomes harder than continuing:**

[Describe what this looks like]

**Signals you've passed it:**

- [Observable signal 1]
- [Observable signal 2]

---

## New Operating State

**Target reality:**

[Describe the desired end state — new capabilities, behaviors, characteristics]

**Key characteristics:**

- [New characteristic 1]
- [New characteristic 2]
- [New characteristic 3]

**Success metrics:**

- [Measurable indicator 1]
- [Measurable indicator 2]

## What Would Regress Them

Risks that would cause backsliding to the original state:

| Regression Risk | Trigger | Prevention |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [What causes it] | [How to prevent] |
| [Risk 2] | [What causes it] | [How to prevent] |
| [Risk 3] | [What causes it] | [How to prevent] |

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Preparation | [Time] | [What happens] |
| Intervention | [Time] | [What happens] |
| Stabilization | [Time] | [What happens] |

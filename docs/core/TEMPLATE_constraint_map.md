# Constraint Map: [OBJECTIVE/CONTEXT]

Use this template when **constraints dominate creativity**. This teaches how you prioritize reality over ideology.

---

## Objective

[What you're trying to achieve]

---

## Hard Constraints

Non-negotiable limits that cannot be violated:

| Constraint | Source | Consequence if Violated |
|------------|--------|-------------------------|
| [Constraint 1] | [Where it comes from] | [What breaks] |
| [Constraint 2] | [Where it comes from] | [What breaks] |
| [Constraint 3] | [Where it comes from] | [What breaks] |

---

## Soft Constraints

Preferences that should be respected but can flex:

| Constraint | Priority | Flexibility |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| [Constraint 1] | High/Med/Low | [How much it can bend] |
| [Constraint 2] | High/Med/Low | [How much it can bend] |
| [Constraint 3] | High/Med/Low | [How much it can bend] |

---

## False Constraints

Things that feel like constraints but aren't:

| Apparent Constraint | Why It's False | What's Actually True |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| [False constraint 1] | [Why it's not real] | [The actual situation] |
| [False constraint 2] | [Why it's not real] | [The actual situation] |

---

## Constraint That Actually Matters Most

**[The single constraint that dominates all design decisions]**

**Why:** [Why this one matters more than others]

---

## Design Implication

Given the constraints above, the solution must:

- [Design requirement 1]
- [Design requirement 2]
- [Design requirement 3]

---

## What Must Be Sacrificed

To satisfy the binding constraint, you must give up:

- [Sacrifice 1] — [Why it's acceptable]
- [Sacrifice 2] — [Why it's acceptable]

---

## Constraint Evolution

How these constraints might change:

| Constraint | Trigger for Change | New State |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| [Constraint 1] | [What would change it] | [What it becomes] |
| [Constraint 2] | [What would change it] | [What it becomes] |

# Mental Model (Plain Language)

This is not a TikTok account.
This is not a content brand.
This is not a funnel.

It’s a **signal → asset → product machine**.

You are building a system that turns attention into structured intelligence products — not virality.

## Core flow

```text
Content → Data → Signal → Asset → Product → Revenue
```

Not:

```text
Content → Followers → Brand → Sponsorships → Ads
```

## What Ghost Network is doing

**Ghost Network = front-facing signal collector.**

TikTok is not the product.
TikTok is not the business.
TikTok is the sensor.

It exists to:

- emit patterns
- test hooks
- probe attention
- collect behavioral data
- generate signal

Not to:

- build a personality brand
- build parasocial trust
- build identity loyalty
- sell merch
- sell influence

## What an “asset” means here

An asset is not a TikTok video.

An asset is a **monetizable output of intelligence**.

Examples:

- Weekly Signal Brief (Asset_0001)
- Pattern Report
- Trend Index
- Signal dataset
- Hook performance map
- Behavioral model
- Distribution model
- Predictive signals
- API feeds / dashboards

## How many assets do you need?

v1 reality: **one**.

Start with the Weekly Signal Brief as the v1 product surface and monetization anchor.

## What happens after the first TikTok video?

### Phase 0 — Signal ignition

Post to test patterns and generate signal.

### Phase 1 — Data accumulation

Each post creates measurable data (views, watch time, completion, loops, shares, saves, comments, velocity).

This becomes your raw intelligence feed (e.g. `posts_export.csv`).

### Phase 2 — Signal aggregation

Weekly aggregation converts raw noise into structured signal (e.g. rollups + dataset health).

### Phase 3 — Intelligence product generation

Generate the Weekly Signal Brief outputs (MD/HTML + appendix dataset + manifest).

This is a real product artifact.

### Phase 4 — Productization

The output becomes a sellable intelligence artifact (not content; not influence).

### Phase 5 — Monetization

You sell the intelligence: signal, patterns, models, data.

## What the Weekly Signal Brief answers

In human terms, it’s a weekly intelligence report for:

- what patterns are working
- what hooks propagate
- what formats hold attention
- what behaviors repeat
- what signals are emerging / decaying / accelerating
- where attention is migrating

Buyers are operators (creators, agencies, analysts, marketers, founders, growth teams) — not fans.

## How many posts before monetization?

There is no fixed number.

Monetization is not based on follower count or virality.

You monetize when:

- patterns stabilize
- hooks repeat
- behaviors replicate
- clusters form

This can happen with 20/50/100 posts — not millions of views.

## The only real rule

Content is upstream.
Products are downstream.
Signal is the bridge.

If you try to monetize content directly → incentives corrupt the data.
If you try to sell before signal → you ship fake products.
If you chase virality → you corrupt the sensor.
If you chase followers → you corrupt the incentives.

# Diagnostic Tree: [SYMPTOM/PROBLEM NAME]

Use this template when **something is failing or unclear**. Mirrors how you debug systems, people, platforms, and institutions.

---

## Observed Symptom

[What you're actually seeing — the presenting problem]

---

## What This Is NOT

- [Incorrect hypothesis 1 — why it's ruled out]
- [Incorrect hypothesis 2 — why it's ruled out]
- [Common misdiagnosis — why it doesn't apply]

---

## Primary Hypotheses (ranked)

| Rank | Hypothesis | Likelihood | Evidence For | Evidence Against |
|------|------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | [Most likely cause] | High/Med/Low | [What supports this] | [What contradicts] |
| 2 | [Second hypothesis] | High/Med/Low | [What supports this] | [What contradicts] |
| 3 | [Third hypothesis] | High/Med/Low | [What supports this] | [What contradicts] |

## Disqualifying Questions for Each

### Hypothesis 1: [Name]

- Question: [What would prove this wrong?]
- Answer: [Result of testing]

### Hypothesis 2: [Name]

- Question: [What would prove this wrong?]
- Answer: [Result of testing]

### Hypothesis 3: [Name]

- Question: [What would prove this wrong?]
- Answer: [Result of testing]

## Fastest Truth-Revealing Test

**Test:** [The single test that would most quickly reveal the true cause]

**Expected Result if Hypothesis 1 is correct:** [What you'd see]

**Expected Result if Hypothesis 2 is correct:** [What you'd see]

---

## Likely Root Cause

**[Your conclusion about the actual cause]**

---

## Secondary Effects

- [What else is impacted by this root cause]
- [Downstream consequences]
- [Hidden dependencies affected]

---

## Action Implied

**Immediate:** [What to do now]

**Follow-up:** [What to do after immediate action]

**Prevention:** [What to change to prevent recurrence]

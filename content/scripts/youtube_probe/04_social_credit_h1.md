## Title

"What if your reputation became a credit score?"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Question)**  
What if your reputation became a credit score?

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
China's social credit system isn't just surveillance.  
It's a distributed reputation mechanism that determines access.  
Travel. Loans. Jobs. School enrollment.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
The West doesn't call it social credit.  
But LinkedIn endorsements, GitHub contributions, Twitter engagement metrics—  
They all function as reputation collateral.  
Your social graph determines your opportunities.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
The difference isn't the mechanism.  
It's who controls the ledger.  
In China, it's centralized.  
Here, it's fragmented across platforms.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
Either way, your behavior is being scored.  
And the score determines access.

The architecture is the same.

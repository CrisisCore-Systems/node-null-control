## Title

"One bad review. Access denied."

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**ACCESS DENIED**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
One bad review. Access denied.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
That's not dystopian fiction. That's how platforms work now.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
Your reputation is already a credit score.  
LinkedIn ranks your employability.  
Airbnb controls your travel access.  
Uber can lock you out permanently.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
These aren't just ratings.  
They're gatekeeping mechanisms.  
One controversial post. One gap in your history.  
And doors start closing.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
China calls it social credit.  
We call it community standards.

The architecture is identical. The enforcement is just privatized.

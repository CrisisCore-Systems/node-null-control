## Title

"AI won't replace workers — it'll make them replaceable"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Contrast)**  
AI won't replace workers. It'll make them replaceable.

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
The threat isn't automation.  
The threat is leverage destruction.  
When a machine can do your work, your bargaining power collapses.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
A junior developer used to have leverage.  
Companies needed humans to write code, review PRs, fix bugs.  
Now, AI handles those tasks in seconds.  
The leverage is gone before the job is.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
The jobs might still exist.  
But the pay drops. The hours increase.  
You become interchangeable.  
That's the mechanism.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
This isn't just tech workers.  
Radiologists. Legal researchers. Financial analysts.

If your work can be described, it can be automated.

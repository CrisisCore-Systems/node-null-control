# Script 03 — AI Displacement H3 (Threat-First Hook)

**Vertical:** AI Displacement  
**Hook Type:** H3 (Threat-First — Loss)  
**Duration Target:** 30-35 seconds  
**Visual Style:** Abstract balance scales, leverage destruction graphics, interchangeable worker icons

---

## Title

"You still have a job. You just lost your leverage."

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**LEVERAGE DESTROYED**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
You still have a job. You just lost your leverage.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
That's the part no one talks about.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
AI doesn't need to replace you.  
It just needs to make you replaceable.  
When a machine does your work faster, your bargaining power collapses.  
Same job. Less value.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
Pay drops. Hours increase. Demands get ignored.  
You're still employed — but you're interchangeable.  
The title stays. The leverage disappears.  
That's not job loss. That's value extraction.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
Developers. Radiologists. Legal researchers. Analysts.  
Anyone whose work can be described faces the same math.

The job survives. The worker doesn't.

## Production Notes

- **Voice:** Neutral synthetic (ElevenLabs or similar)
- **Pacing:** Fast hook, aggressive body, deliberate close
- **Visuals:** Balance scales tipping → interchangeable icons → value extraction graphics (abstract)
- **Subtitles:** Bold text, high contrast
- **First Frame:** Must change visually in <0.5s with "LEVERAGE DESTROYED"
- **End Frame:** No CTA, no logo — let it loop

## Thumbnail

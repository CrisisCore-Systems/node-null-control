## Title

"You're being auctioned every 8 seconds."

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**YOU'RE THE INVENTORY**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
You're being auctioned every 8 seconds.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
Every scroll. Every pause. Another bid.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
Advertisers bid on your eyeballs in real-time.  
The algorithm sells to the highest bidder.  
You see the ad. Platform gets paid.  
That's the entire business model.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
The feed isn't designed for relevance.  
It's designed for extraction.  
Rage keeps you scrolling. Outrage keeps you clicking.  
Whatever works, gets promoted.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
You're not browsing. You're being farmed.  
You're not the customer. You're the product.

And the auction runs every time you open the app.

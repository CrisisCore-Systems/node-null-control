"Why does every app feel like a slot machine?"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Question)**  
Why does every app feel like a slot machine?

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
It's not an accident.  
Pull-to-refresh. Infinite scroll. Variable rewards.  
These are deliberate mechanisms borrowed from gambling psychology.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
Social platforms don't sell products.  
They sell your attention to advertisers.  
The longer you stay, the more they earn.  
So they architect compulsion loops into the interface.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
Red notification badges. Autoplay. Endless feeds.  
Every design choice optimizes for one metric:  
Time on platform.  
Your attention is the product.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
You're not the customer.  
You're the inventory.

And the auction never stops.

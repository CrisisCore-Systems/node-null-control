## Title

"You're already living in a social credit system"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Statement)**  
You're already living in a social credit system.

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
LinkedIn ranks your employability.  
GitHub scores your developer credibility.  
Twitter engagement determines your reach.  
Airbnb ratings control your travel access.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
These aren't just metrics.  
They're gatekeeping mechanisms.  
One bad review, one controversial tweet, one gap in your commit history—  
And your access to opportunities shrinks.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
The difference from China's system?  
Theirs is centralized. Ours is distributed.  
But the outcome is identical:  
Behavior modification through reputation surveillance.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
The architecture is already built.  
The only question is whether we admit it exists.

Or keep pretending it doesn't.

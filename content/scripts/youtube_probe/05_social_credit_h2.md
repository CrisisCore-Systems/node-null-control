# Script 05 — Social Credit H2 (Threat-First Hook)

**Vertical:** Social Credit  
**Hook Type:** H2 (Threat-First — Trap)  
**Duration Target:** 30-35 seconds  
**Visual Style:** Abstract platform interfaces, behavior tracking graphics, invisible scoring systems

---

## Title

"You're being scored right now."

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**YOU'RE BEING SCORED**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
You're being scored right now.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
Every platform tracks behavior. Most don't tell you.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
LinkedIn measures engagement patterns.  
GitHub tracks contribution frequency.  
Twitter calculates reach limits.  
These scores determine what you see — and who sees you.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
One gap in activity. One controversial take.  
Your reach shrinks. Your visibility drops.  
No notification. No explanation.  
The algorithm just stops showing you to people.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
We call China's system authoritarian.  
We call ours "personalization."

The scoring is the same. The transparency isn't.

- **First Frame:** Must change visually in <0.5s with "YOU'RE BEING SCORED"

---

## Title

"The ladder is being pulled up."

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**THE LADDER IS GONE**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
The ladder is being pulled up.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
And no one's telling the people still climbing.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
Companies aren't firing juniors.  
They're just not hiring new ones.  
AI handles the tasks that used to train people.  
The entry points are closing.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
Code reviews. Documentation. Research.  
The work that built careers now gets automated.  
No junior roles means no path to senior positions.  
The pipeline doesn't break — it disappears.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
Law. Medicine. Finance. Engineering.  
Every field with repetitive entry work faces the same trap.

By the time you notice, the path is already gone.

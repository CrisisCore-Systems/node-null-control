## Title

"Junior roles are disappearing — but not how you think"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Statement)**  
Junior roles are disappearing. But not how you think.

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
Companies aren't firing people.  
They're just not replacing them when they leave.  
The hiring pipeline is drying up.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
AI handles the onboarding tasks that used to train juniors.  
Code reviews. Documentation. Bug fixes.  
The learning ladder is being removed while people are still on it.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
No junior roles means no path to senior positions.  
The system doesn't collapse suddenly.  
It just stops creating new entry points.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
This applies to law. Medicine. Finance.  
Any field where leverage comes from repetition.

The bottleneck is tightening.

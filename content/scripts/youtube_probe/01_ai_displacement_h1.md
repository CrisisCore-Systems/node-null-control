# Script 01 — AI Displacement H1 (Threat-First Hook)

**Vertical:** AI Displacement  
**Hook Type:** H1 (Threat-First — Consequence)  
**Duration Target:** 30-35 seconds  
**Visual Style:** Abstract data visualization, wage collapse graphics, automation metrics

---

## Title

"Your job doesn't disappear. It gets cheaper."

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**WAGES COLLAPSE FIRST**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
Your job doesn't disappear. It gets cheaper.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
That's how AI displacement actually works.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
When automation handles part of a role, the rest becomes interchangeable.  
If anyone can do it, no one can demand more pay.  
Wages collapse first. Layoffs come later.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
Companies don't need to fire you.  
They just stop paying what you're worth.  
Your title stays. Your leverage disappears.  
The job market doesn't shrink — it deflates.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
That's why "AI taking jobs" is the wrong conversation.  
The real damage starts earlier.

And most people won't notice until it's already happened.

## Production Notes

- **Voice:** Neutral synthetic (ElevenLabs or similar)
- **Pacing:** Fast hook, measured body, deliberate close
- **Visuals:** Wage graphs dropping → interchangeable worker icons → deflating dollar signs (abstract)
- **Subtitles:** Bold text, high contrast
- **First Frame:** Must change visually in <0.5s with "WAGES COLLAPSE FIRST"
- **End Frame:** No CTA, no logo — let it loop

## Thumbnail

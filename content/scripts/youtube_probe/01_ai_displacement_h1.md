## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Question)**  
What happens when AI gets too good at junior dev work?

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
The mechanism is simple. AI reduces the value of repetitive tasks.  
Junior roles are mostly repetitive tasks.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
When your leverage depends on doing what a model can now do in seconds,  
your bargaining power approaches zero.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
Companies don't need to fire you. They just stop hiring replacements.  
The junior pipeline collapses.  
Senior roles become unreachable.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
And this isn't just software.  
This is legal research. Radiology. Financial analysis.

The threshold is closer than it looks.

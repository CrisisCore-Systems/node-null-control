## Title

"Social media isn't social — it's an extraction economy"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Contrast)**  
Social media isn't social. It's an extraction economy.

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
We think of platforms as communication tools.  
But their revenue model depends on attention extraction.  
You're not connecting. You're being harvested.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
The "algorithm" isn't neutral.  
It amplifies whatever keeps you scrolling.  
Outrage. Envy. Fear. Curiosity.  
If it stops you from leaving, it gets promoted.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
Platforms don't care about truth or nuance.  
They optimize for engagement metrics.  
Rage-bait outperforms thoughtful discussion.  
Because rage keeps you here longer.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
This isn't a bug.  
It's the business model.

Your attention is the commodity.

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**RAGE GETS REWARDED**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
Rage gets rewarded. That's the business model.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
The algorithm doesn't care about truth. It cares about time.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
Outrage stops thumbs.  
Anger triggers shares.  
Fear drives clicks.  
Whatever keeps you engaged gets amplified.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
Nuance doesn't perform.  
Thoughtful takes get buried.  
The feed optimizes for reaction, not quality.  
That's why everything feels more extreme.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
You're not being informed. You're being harvested.  
Your attention is the commodity. Your emotions are the extraction method.

And the algorithm never stops optimizing.

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
Banned. No explanation. No appeal.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
That's not dystopia. That's platform policy.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
Uber bans riders without telling them why.  
PayPal freezes accounts based on patterns.  
Twitter shadow-bans without notification.  
Your access disappears. The reason doesn't.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
There's no court. No due process.  
One algorithmic flag and you're out.  
Years of history. Gone.  
Reputation you built. Erased.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
This isn't social credit with Chinese characteristics.  
It's social credit with terms of service.

Same mechanism. Different branding.

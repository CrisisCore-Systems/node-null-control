## Title

"Social credit isn't dystopian fiction — it's platform infrastructure"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Contrast)**  
Social credit isn't dystopian fiction. It's platform infrastructure.

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
We think of social credit as a Chinese surveillance tool.  
But every platform you use operates on the same principle:  
Behavior tracking. Reputation scoring. Access control.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
Uber bans riders with low ratings.  
PayPal freezes accounts based on transaction patterns.  
Twitter shadow-bans users without explanation.  
Your reputation score determines your platform access.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
The mechanism is identical.  
Centralized or distributed doesn't matter.  
If your score drops, your access shrinks.  
The enforcement is just outsourced to private companies.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
This isn't coming.  
It's already here.

We just call it "community standards."

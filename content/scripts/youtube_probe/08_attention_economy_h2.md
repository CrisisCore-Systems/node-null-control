## Title

"Your attention is being auctioned in real-time"

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Statement)**  
Your attention is being auctioned in real-time.

**[2-7s] Threat Framing**  
Every time you open an app, an auction runs.  
Advertisers bid on your eyeballs.  
The algorithm sells to the highest bidder.  
You see the ad. The platform gets paid.

**[7-16s] Disturbing Insight**  
The feed isn't chronological because that's inefficient.  
It's algorithmic because that maximizes attention extraction.  
Every post, every video, every notification—  
Optimized to keep you scrolling.

**[16-24s] Escalation**  
This isn't about showing you relevant content.  
It's about maximizing session duration.  
Rage-bait gets engagement. Outrage gets clicks.  
The algorithm rewards what keeps you here.

**[24-28s] Open Loop (Unresolved)**  
You're not browsing.  
You're being farmed.

And the harvest never ends.

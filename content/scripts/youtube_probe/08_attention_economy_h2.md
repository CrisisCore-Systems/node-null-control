## Title

"That app is a slot machine."

## On-Screen Text (First Frame)

**ENGINEERED COMPULSION**

## Script

**[0-2s] Hook (Threat-First)**  
That app is a slot machine.

**[2-4s] Immediate Follow-Up**  
Same psychology. Same mechanics. Different interface.

**[4-12s] Mechanism (Aggressive)**  
Pull-to-refresh is a lever pull.  
Infinite scroll eliminates stopping points.  
Variable rewards trigger dopamine.  
These aren't features. They're compulsion loops.

**[12-22s] Escalation**  
Red badges create urgency.  
Autoplay eliminates choices.  
The feed never ends.  
Every design decision optimizes for one metric: time on platform.

**[22-30s] Pattern Stamp (Open Loop)**  
Casinos need licenses.  
Apps just need downloads.

Same extraction. Zero regulation.

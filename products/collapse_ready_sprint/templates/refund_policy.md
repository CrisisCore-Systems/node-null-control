Document: Collapse-Ready Sprint — Refund Policy

Version: v01

---

## Policy Overview

The Collapse-Ready Sprint operates under a **conditional refund policy** designed to protect both parties while maintaining operational integrity.

---

## Refund Eligibility

### Refunds ARE Allowed When:

| Condition | Refund Type | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intake rejected due to missing/incompatible inputs | Full refund | Within 7 days |
| Client cannot provide required access | Full refund | Within 7 days |
| Scope mismatch discovered before sprint start | Full refund | Within 7 days |
| Engagement cancelled by provider | Full refund | Within 7 days |

### Refunds are NOT Allowed When:

| Condition | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Sprint has started | Workspace and documents created |
| Client fails to complete intake within deadline | Client responsibility |
| Client becomes unresponsive after sprint start | Work already in progress |
| Client dissatisfied with findings | Deliverables provided as scoped |
| Client wants scope changes mid-sprint | Fixed scope engagement |

---

## Sprint Start Definition

**The sprint officially starts when:**

1. Intake form is validated and accepted
2. Google Drive workspace is created
3. Document templates are instantiated
4. "Sprint Activated" email is sent

**⚠️ Once the sprint starts, no refunds are available.**

This is system-enforced, not discretionary.

---

## Refund Process

### For Eligible Refunds

1. Refund request submitted via email or form
2. Eligibility verified against policy
3. Stripe refund initiated (full amount)
4. Confirmation email sent
5. Notion record closed

**Processing Time:** 5-10 business days for funds to appear

### For Partial Refunds (Optional)

In exceptional circumstances, partial refunds may be offered:

| Scenario | Partial Refund | Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Incomplete intake, deadline expired | Up to 50% | At provider discretion |
| Access issues discovered after sprint start | Up to 25% | At provider discretion |

Partial refunds are not guaranteed and are evaluated case-by-case.

---

## Policy Rationale

### Why No Refunds After Sprint Start?

1. **Resource Commitment:** Sprint start triggers immediate work allocation
2. **Workspace Creation:** Documents and infrastructure have been provisioned
3. **Time Block:** The 14-day sprint window is reserved exclusively
4. **Deliverable Nature:** Security assessments cannot be "returned"

### Why Conditional Refunds Pre-Sprint?

1. **Fairness:** Clients shouldn't pay for services they cannot receive
2. **Access Issues:** Some systems cannot be assessed as scoped
3. **Scope Mismatch:** Better to discover misalignment early
4. **Quality:** Forcing incompatible engagements produces poor outcomes

## Client Communication

### At Purchase (Stripe Checkout)

Refund policy summary displayed before payment.

### In Intake Email

> **Refund Policy Reminder:**
> 
> Refunds are available only if:
> - Intake is rejected due to missing or incompatible inputs
> - You cannot provide required access
> - Scope mismatch is discovered before sprint start
> 
> Once the sprint starts (workspace created), no refunds are available.

### In Sprint Activated Email

## Dispute Handling

### For Payment Disputes (Chargebacks)

| Scenario | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Dispute filed after sprint start | Contest with evidence of work |
| Dispute filed pre-sprint (eligible refund) | Accept and process refund |
| Dispute filed pre-sprint (not eligible) | Contest with policy evidence |

### Evidence for Disputes

- Intake form submission timestamp
- Workspace creation timestamp
- Email delivery confirmations

## Policy Enforcement

This policy is enforced by the automation system:

1. Refund eligibility checked against intake status
2. Sprint start timestamp logged
3. Stripe refunds triggered only for eligible conditions
4. All transactions logged for audit

No manual overrides without documented exception.

- [ ] Executive Summary document completed
- [ ] Delivery package assembled (PDFs + README)

### 4.2 Quality Criteria

- [ ] Respond to clarifying questions within 24h
- [ ] Acknowledge scope lock before sprint start
- [ ] Confirm receipt of delivery package

---

## 6. Assumptions

- Information provided during intake is accurate
- System documentation is current
- Access credentials are valid
- No major system changes during sprint
- {{additional_assumptions}}

---

## 7. Change Management

### 7.1 Scope Changes

Scope changes after sprint start require:

1. New engagement (separate purchase)
2. Fresh intake process
3. Separate delivery timeline

No scope creep. No exceptions.

### 7.2 Minor Clarifications

Minor clarifications (not scope changes) handled via async communication.

---

## 8. Acknowledgment

By proceeding with the sprint, client acknowledges:

- [ ] Scope is fixed as documented

7. LIABILITY

Provider liability is limited to the engagement fee paid.

Provider is NOT liable for:
- Security incidents occurring after delivery
- Client's failure to implement recommendations
- Third-party actions or omissions
- Consequential or indirect damages

---

8. DISAGREEMENT & EVALUATION

Findings represent bounded analysis under explicitly stated assumptions and scope.

Disagreement with conclusions does not invalidate delivery.

Alternate conclusions require alternate assumptions, which must be documented 
separately.

Provider is not obligated to:
- Revise conclusions to accommodate preference, interpretation, or external pressure
- Engage in rebuttal cycles
- Modify findings without new evidence

Delivery is complete upon receipt confirmation, regardless of agreement with 
findings.

---

9. CLIENT DELAY POLICY

The sprint timeline begins upon workspace creation (T0).

Client delays (including delayed access, incomplete materials, or partial 
responses) do not extend the sprint unless explicitly agreed in writing.

Access Window: Client must provide required system access within 72 hours of 
sprint start (T0 + 72h).

If required access is not provided within the access window, the sprint will 
proceed with available materials and may close with partial findings.

Sprint Duration: 14 calendar days from T0, regardless of client behavior.

No refunds are issued once the sprint has started.

---

10. ACCEPTANCE

By completing payment and intake, Client accepts these terms.

Engagement is governed by these terms and the scope lock document.

# Collapse-Ready Systems Hardening™ — Landing Page

## HERO

### Collapse-Ready Systems Hardening™

**An artifact-based audit-to-hardening sprint for systems that must survive scrutiny.**

No credentials required.
No trust assumed.
Everything is inspectable.

**14 days · Fixed scope · Async-only**

[ Check Eligibility ]

## WHAT THIS IS

This is a fixed-scope intervention for systems where failure is not theoretical.

The output is not advice.
It is a set of **written artifacts** designed to hold up under:

* legal dispute
* regulatory review
* adversarial interpretation
* operational stress

If the artifacts do not survive inspection, they should not be used.

---

## WHAT THIS IS NOT

* Not consulting
* Not staff augmentation
* Not certification
* Not compliance sign-off
* Not ongoing support

No calls by default.
No scope creep.
No authority claims.

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

This is for operators who:

* ship or rely on privacy-critical systems
* have real exposure, not hypothetical risk
* need work that survives third-party review
* prefer written clarity over meetings

Typical use cases:

* sensitive-data software
* evidence systems
* pre-audit or post-incident hardening

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Eligibility Check**
   Fit is determined before payment.

2. **Sprint Activation**
   Scope is locked. Timeline starts.

3. **Audit & Hardening**
   Threat model, data flows, failure modes, and pass/fail gates are produced.

4. **Hostile Review**
   Artifacts are checked under adversarial assumptions.

5. **Delivery**
   Final package is delivered with cryptographic integrity hashes.

No acceptance required.
Delivery completes the engagement.

---

## WHAT YOU RECEIVE

* Explicit threat model
* Complete data-flow map
* Failure & exposure register
* Hardening actions (blocking vs non-blocking)
* Pass/fail release gates
* Executive-readable summary
* Integrity-verified delivery package

All outputs are written.
All claims are traceable.

---

## HOW THIS IS EVALUATED

This engagement is not evaluated by credentials or authority.

It is evaluated by:

* inspectability
* traceability
* adversarial readability
* integrity verification

Disagreement is documented, not negotiated.

---

## PRICE & TERMS

**$25,000 — Fixed-scope sprint**
**+$5,000 — Optional single call (post-delivery only)**

* Async-only
* Conditional refunds (pre-sprint only)
* No extensions by delay
* No implied guarantees

---

## VERIFICATION

Every delivery includes SHA-256 hashes and timestamped integrity records.

Any third party can independently verify that the artifacts have not been altered since delivery.

No trust required.

---

## CTA

**Check Eligibility**

If this is not a fit, the system will say so.

> I don't sell trust. I deliver work that survives inspection.

## How to use templates

### Step 1: Choose your format

Determine your content duration and goal:

| If you need... | Use... |
| --- | --- |
| Quick, punchy content (15-25s) | 20s script + short form structure |
| Standard content (25-35s) | 30s script + short form structure |
| Educational content (30-60s) | 30s/60s script + educational structure |
| Story-based content (30-60s) | 30s/60s script + narrative structure |

### Step 2: Select a hook

Choose from hook templates based on your content:

| Hook type | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| H1 Question | Challenging assumptions, creating curiosity |
| H2 Statement | Establishing authority, presenting insights |
| H3 Contrast | Creating tension, showing differences |
| H4 Curiosity | Building mystery, creating information gaps |

### Step 3: Fill in the template

Replace variables with your content:

1. Start with the hook
2. Fill in the main content sections
3. Craft the ending
4. Review timing and word count

### Step 4: Choose a caption style

Select based on platform and content:

| Caption | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| Minimal | Algorithm-optimized, short-form platforms |
| Story | Context-heavy content, longer explanations |
| CTA-Free | Clean presentation, letting content speak |

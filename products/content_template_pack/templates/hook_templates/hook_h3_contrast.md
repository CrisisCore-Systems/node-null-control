# Hook Template H3 — Contrast Hook

Version: v01

## Structure

```
[Juxtaposition of two ideas that creates tension or interest]
```

## Timing

- Duration: 2-4 seconds
- Placement: First line/frame

## Formula

```
"{{element_a}} vs {{element_b}}: {{tension_point}}"
```

or

```
"{{common_belief}}, but {{contrasting_reality}}"
```

## Variables

- `{{element_a}}`: First element of comparison
- `{{element_b}}`: Second element (contrasting)
- `{{tension_point}}`: Why the contrast matters
- `{{common_belief}}`: What people typically think
- `{{contrasting_reality}}`: What the evidence shows

## Examples (structure only)

- "[Expectation] vs [Reality]: what the data shows"
- "Most people think [X], but [Y] is actually happening"
- "[Thing A] and [Thing B] aren't what they seem"

## Guidelines

- Contrast must be genuine, not manufactured
- Both elements should be fairly represented
- Tension should be intellectually interesting
- Resolution should be in the content

## Anti-patterns (do NOT use)

- False dichotomies
- Misleading comparisons
- Us vs them framing
- Conflict designed to anger rather than inform

## Mitigation Patterns

**NOT PRESCRIPTIVE. NOT ADVICE. PATTERN DOCUMENTATION ONLY.**

These patterns document observable strategies. They do not constitute recommendations, advice, or guarantees. Use at your own discretion.

---

### Pattern Category 1: Leverage Preservation Strategies

**Definition:** Patterns observed in workers who maintain bargaining power during automation waves.

**Observable patterns:**

#### Pattern 1A: Shift to Non-Routine Tasks

**Description:**  
Workers who survive displacement often move toward tasks that resist automation: high-context decision-making, ambiguous problem-solving, cross-functional coordination.

**Examples:**
- Junior developer → Technical architect (high-context design)
- Data entry → Process optimization (ambiguous problem-solving)
- Customer service → Customer success (relationship-building)

**Characteristics:**
- Tasks require judgment, not just execution
- Outcomes are context-dependent
- Human interaction is central
- Difficult to standardize

#### Pattern 1B: Build Cross-Functional Knowledge

**Description:**  
Workers who combine skills from multiple domains create unique value propositions that are harder to automate.

**Examples:**
- Software developer + UX design
- Legal researcher + data analysis
- Content writer + SEO strategy

**Characteristics:**
- Combines technical and non-technical skills
- Bridges organizational silos
- Facilitates coordination across teams

#### Pattern 1C: Develop Judgment-Intensive Skills

**Description:**  
Skills that require accumulated experience, contextual understanding, and nuanced decision-making tend to resist automation longer.

**Examples:**
- Negotiation (requires reading human signals)
- Crisis management (requires rapid context-switching)
- Strategic planning (requires long-term thinking)

**Characteristics:**
- High-stakes decisions
- Ambiguous problem spaces
- Requires trust/reputation
- Experience compounds value

### Pattern Category 2: Non-Commoditizable Skill Identification

**Definition:** Skills that remain difficult to automate due to inherent characteristics.

**Observable patterns:**

#### Pattern 2A: High-Context, High-Ambiguity Domains

**Description:**  
Work that requires deep contextual knowledge and comfort with ambiguity resists automation.

**Examples:**
- Executive coaching (requires understanding organizational politics)
- Venture capital investing (requires pattern recognition + judgment)
- Crisis communication (requires rapid adaptation to context)

**Characteristics:**
- No clear "right answer"
- Context changes rapidly
- Requires reading subtle signals
- Judgment outweighs execution speed

#### Pattern 2B: Interpersonal Dynamics & Negotiation

**Description:**  
Skills centered on human relationships, trust-building, and negotiation remain human-dependent.

**Examples:**
- Sales (complex B2B)
- Mediation/arbitration
- Executive recruiting

**Characteristics:**
- Trust is central to the transaction
- Emotional intelligence required
- Long-term relationships matter
- Reading non-verbal cues essential

#### Pattern 2C: Creative Synthesis

**Description:**  
Combining disparate ideas into novel solutions resists automation (for now).

**Examples:**
- Product design (combining user needs + technical constraints + market positioning)
- Strategic consulting (synthesizing data + industry knowledge + client context)
- Creative direction (combining brand identity + market trends + cultural context)

**Characteristics:**
- Novel combinations, not pattern matching
- Requires taste/judgment
- Hard to evaluate objectively
- Value is subjective

### Pattern Category 3: Market Position Shifting

**Definition:** Patterns in how workers navigate displacement by shifting to adjacent, less-saturated markets.

**Observable patterns:**

#### Pattern 3A: Moving to Adjacent Roles Before Displacement

**Description:**  
Workers who shift before their sector reaches the threshold avoid the labor flood.

**Examples:**
- Junior developer → Product manager (before AI coding tools mature)
- Graphic designer → Brand strategist (before generative design tools commoditize)
- Legal researcher → Legal operations (before LLMs dominate research)

**Timing indicator:**
- Shift when automation penetration reaches ~30-40%
- Before mass displacement begins
- While adjacent roles still have openings

#### Pattern 3B: Geographic Arbitrage

**Description:**  
Some workers relocate to markets with different automation penetration rates or regulatory environments.

**Examples:**
- Moving to regions with slower AI adoption
- Relocating to sectors with regulatory protection
- Remote work enabling access to global markets

**Considerations:**
- Cost of living differences
- Visa/immigration requirements
- Cultural/language factors

#### Pattern 3C: Sector Rotation Timing

**Description:**  
Workers who rotate between sectors strategically avoid displacement waves.

**Examples:**
- Tech worker → Healthcare (slower automation due to regulation)
- Finance analyst → Government/NGO (slower adoption cycles)
- Media professional → Education (relationship-intensive)

**Timing patterns:**
- Rotate before threshold is reached
- Move to sectors 2-5 years behind in automation curve
- Seek sectors with structural barriers to automation

### Pattern Category 4: Portfolio Approaches

**Definition:** Workers diversifying income sources and skill sets to reduce single-point-of-failure risk.

**Observable patterns:**

#### Pattern 4A: Multiple Income Streams

**Description:**  
Workers building parallel revenue sources to reduce dependence on single employer/sector.

**Examples:**
- Full-time job + consulting work
- Employment + product revenue (courses, ebooks, tools)
- Multiple part-time contracts vs. one full-time role

**Risk mitigation:**
- No single employer dependency
- Diversified income sources
- Faster adaptation to market changes

#### Pattern 4B: Skill Diversification

**Description:**  
Building competencies across multiple domains to increase adaptability.

**Examples:**
- Developer learning marketing/sales
- Designer learning product management
- Writer learning data analysis

**Benefit:**
- Faster pivots when displacement occurs
- Bridges organizational gaps
- Increases perceived value

#### Pattern 4C: Platform vs. Full-Time Employment

**Description:**  
Some workers shift from traditional employment to platform-based work (Upwork, Toptal, etc.) to access global markets and diversify client base.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Global market access, diversified clients
- Con: No benefits, unstable income, high competition
- Consider: Platform fees, payment terms, client acquisition cost

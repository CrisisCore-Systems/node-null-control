# Data Assumptions & Methodology

## Overview

The Displacement Risk Atlas uses heuristic proximity indicators to analyze sectors approaching automation displacement thresholds. These are **procedural observations**, not predictions or guarantees.

## Data Sources

All data synthesized from publicly available sources accessed between 2026-01-15 and 2026-02-03:

- Bureau of Labor Statistics (Employment projections, occupational outlook)
- McKinsey Global Institute (Future of Work Reports, 2025)
- World Economic Forum (Future of Jobs Report 2025)
- GitHub (Copilot usage statistics, 2025-2026)
- StackOverflow (Developer Survey 2025)

## Key Metrics Explained

### Automation Penetration (%)

**Definition:** Estimated percentage of routine tasks in a sector that can currently be automated with available technology.

**Important Notes:**
- These are approximations and proxies, not exact measurements
- Based on task analysis and tool capability reports
- Does not predict adoption rate or timeline
- Higher penetration ≠ immediate job loss (regulatory, economic, and organizational factors matter)

### Proximity Score (0-10)

**Definition:** Heuristic indicator of how close a sector is to the "leverage collapse" threshold.

**Calculation Factors:**
- Current automation penetration
- Rate of technology improvement in relevant domains
- Replacement cost vs automation cost ratio
- Observable market dynamics (hiring trends, tool adoption)

**Important Notes:**
- Not a prediction or forecast
- Not a timeline estimate
- Intended as a relative comparison tool only
- Updated periodically based on new data

### Task Commoditization Indicators

Lists of routine tasks identified as having HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW automation potential based on:
- Current tool capabilities (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, GitHub Copilot)
- Successful automation deployments in similar contexts
- Task complexity and judgment requirements

### Adjacent Market Pressure

Lists of related job markets where displaced workers might seek employment, with saturation risk assessments.

**Saturation Risk Levels:**
- HIGH: Market likely to be saturated by displaced workers
- MEDIUM: Market has some capacity but limited
- LOW: Market has capacity or requires different skills

### Timeline Estimates

**Near-term (0-2 years):** Current observable trends
**Mid-term (2-5 years):** Projected mechanism completion based on historical patterns

**Critical Disclaimer:** These are NOT predictions. They are procedural extrapolations of current trends. Actual outcomes will vary based on:
- Regulatory changes
- Economic conditions
- Technology development pace
- Organizational adoption rates
- Social and political factors

## What This Data IS

✅ Mechanism analysis  
✅ Pattern documentation  
✅ Procedural observation  
✅ System description  
✅ Heuristic indicators

## What This Data IS NOT

❌ Career advice  
❌ Financial advice  
❌ Guaranteed outcomes  
❌ Prescriptive recommendations  
❌ Precise predictions  
❌ Timeline guarantees

## Limitations

1. **Data Lag:** All source data is historical. Current conditions may differ.
2. **Approximation:** Percentages are proxies, not exact measurements.
3. **Incomplete Coverage:** Not all relevant factors can be quantified.
4. **Model Uncertainty:** Heuristic scores involve subjective assessment.
5. **Rapid Change:** Technology landscape evolves faster than data collection.

## Update Policy

Sector data and proximity scores are reviewed quarterly. Updates reflect:
- New employment data releases
- Major technology capability improvements
- Significant market shifts
- User feedback on accuracy

Version history tracked in `sectors.json` metadata (future versions).

## Usage Guidelines

This data should be used for:
- Understanding mechanism dynamics
- Identifying pattern similarities across sectors
- Comparative analysis of displacement risk factors
- Educational purposes

This data should NOT be used for:
- Making career decisions without additional research
- Financial planning or investment decisions
- Legal or regulatory compliance assessments
- Predictive modeling or forecasting

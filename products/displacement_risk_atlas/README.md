## What It Is

A procedural analysis of 10 sectors approaching automation displacement thresholds.

## Structure

### Part 1: Framework (5 pages)

**Core concepts:**

1. **Leverage Destruction Mechanism**
   - How automation reduces worker bargaining power
   - Task commoditization vs. irreplaceability
   - The leverage collapse threshold

2. **Bargaining Power Threshold Model**
   - When does leverage approach zero?
   - Replacement cost vs. automation cost crossover
   - Junior vs. senior leverage dynamics

3. **Cascading Displacement Pattern**
   - Historical precedent: Manufacturing → Clerical → Customer Service
   - Labor flood mechanism (displaced workers seek adjacent markets)
   - Timeline compression in AI era

4. **Mitigation Framework**
   - Non-commoditizable skill identification
   - Leverage preservation strategies
   - Market position shifting tactics
   - Portfolio approaches

### Part 2: Sector Analysis (10 pages, 1 per sector)

Each sector includes:

- **Current automation penetration (%)** — How much work is already automated
- **Leverage collapse threshold proximity** — How close to the tipping point
- **Task commoditization indicators** — Which tasks are becoming routine/automatable
- **Adjacent market pressure points** — Where displaced workers will flood next
- **Timeline estimates** — Procedural, not predictive; based on current trajectories

**Sectors covered:**

1. **AI/ML Engineering (Junior roles)**
2. **Legal Research**
3. **Medical Diagnostics (Radiology)**
4. **Financial Analysis**
5. **Content Production (Media)**
6. **Customer Service (Enterprise)**
7. **Data Entry/Processing**
8. **Junior Software Development**

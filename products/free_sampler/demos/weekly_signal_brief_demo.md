# Weekly Signal Brief — Demo (Sampler)

What it is:

- A weekly, decision-ready brief format that turns exports/rollups into: (1) an executive signal summary, (2) winners/losers tables, (3) next-week decisions.

What it produces:

- A PDF/HTML/Markdown brief you can send internally or to clients (Commercial tier).

Why it’s useful:

- Replaces "here are the numbers" with "here’s what changed and what we’ll do next".
- Enforces sample awareness (valid/invalid rates, drift flags).

Sample structure (excerpt):

- Executive signal (one paragraph + 3 highest-confidence shifts)
- Dataset health (missing metrics, invalid reasons, drift flags)
- Winners / Losers (top hooks + top verticals)
- Decisions (kill / scale / iterate)

If you want the full kit:

- Templates + schemas + a safe fixture run are included in the paid versions.

# Hook Performance Index — Demo (Sampler)

What it is:

- A weekly index that ranks hook types using a composite score and supporting medians.

What you get in the paid kit:

- Templates (MD/HTML/CSS)
- Optional builder script to generate the index from `hooks_rollup.csv`
- A run structure that keeps snapshots immutable

What the output looks like:

- A "Top hooks" table with rank, hook_type, samples, score_median, and supporting metrics.
- A dataset note so you don’t over-trust small or drifting weeks.

Where it fits:

- Pair with the Content Template Pack (create) and Weekly Signal Brief (report).

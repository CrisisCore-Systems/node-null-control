# Vertical Performance Index — Demo (Sampler)

What it is:

- A repeatable index for comparing performance across verticals (topics/segments) to decide where to focus.

What it enforces:

- Fair comparisons (sample counts, data health notes)
- Clear decisions (double down / maintain / pause / test)

Where it fits:

- Use it when you manage multiple verticals and need a weekly/monthly allocation view.

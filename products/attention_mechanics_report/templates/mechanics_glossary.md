# Attention Mechanics Glossary v01

Standard definitions for terms used in Attention Mechanics Reports.

---

## Attention metrics

### Attention capture rate
The percentage of users who engage with content within the first 1-2 seconds of exposure.

### Sustained attention rate
The percentage of users who remain engaged past the initial capture point (typically >5 seconds).

### Drop-off point
The timestamp at which the median user stops engaging with content.

### Re-engagement rate
The percentage of users who return to or loop content after initial viewing.

---

## Behavioral terms

### Passive consumption
Users viewing content without active engagement (no likes, comments, shares, saves).

### Active engagement
Users performing explicit actions on content (likes, comments, shares, saves).

### Completion
Users reaching the end of content (100% view for video, scroll-to-bottom for text).

### Loop
Users replaying content, either intentionally or via autoplay.

---

## Platform mechanics

### Initial distribution
The first phase of content distribution, typically to a test audience segment.

### Expansion phase
Secondary distribution to wider audience based on initial performance signals.

### Saturation
Point at which content reaches diminishing returns in its target audience.

### Algorithmic signal
Metrics used by platform algorithms to determine content distribution.

## Analysis terms

### Confidence level
Degree of certainty in analysis conclusions based on sample size and data quality.
- **High**: Large sample (>100), consistent patterns, low variance
- **Medium**: Moderate sample (50-100), recognizable patterns, moderate variance
- **Low**: Small sample (<50), inconsistent patterns, high variance

### Drift flag
Indicator that metrics or patterns have shifted significantly from baseline.

### Signal stability
Measure of how consistent a pattern is across time periods and samples.

### Correlation
Statistical relationship between two variables (not causation).

## Ethical boundaries

### Analysis scope
This glossary and associated reports are limited to observation and analysis. They do not include:
- Manipulation techniques
- Exploitation strategies
- Addiction mechanics
- Dark patterns

### Educational purpose
All terms and analyses are provided for educational understanding of platform mechanics, not for weaponization against users.
